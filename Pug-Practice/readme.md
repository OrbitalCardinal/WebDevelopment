# Usage of pug view engine
1. Install pug and pug-cli with npm like: "npm install pug -g" and "npm install pug-cli -g" to use the command line pug tools.
2. To render a pug file and convert it to HTML use the command "pug -w file.pug -o folder -P" the argument "-w" tells pug to watch any changes in the file and re-render the html, the  "-o" tells pug to send the html rendered file to a rute, and the "-P" tells pug to generate pretty HTML code.
